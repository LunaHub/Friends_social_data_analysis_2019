There has been a lot of discussion about who is the maincharacter in friends. 
If we look at the percentage of lines among the friends and who has the most lines, the maincharacter in the first three seasons is Ross with 20-21% of the lines. In season 4 and 5, Chandler is then the one with the most lines (17-5-18.4%), in season 6 it's shared between Rachel and Chandler who have 18.5-18.3% of the lines then in season 7, 8 and 9 Rachel takes over with 19.9-20.7% of the lines in 7 and 8 and then declines down to 17.4%. Season 9 is the season with the most evenly distribued number of lines between the friends. In the last season, Ross is back with the most lines (19.8%)

Compared to the percentage where the friends are mentioned by each other, a similar pattern shows. Except for in season 7, Ross is the one who is mentioned most frequent. Monica is not mentioned that much but in season this changes and she is the one who is mentioned 22.4% of the time (because she gets married to Chandler?)
The two people who mentione her the most in season 7 is Rachel who mentiones Monica 51 times and Chandler mentiones her name 85 times in the season.
In total Ross is mentioned 2055 times followed by Joey who is mentioned 1729 times.

The friend that Joey mentiones the most in total is Ross (398) followed by Chandler (386)

The friend that Rachel mentiones the most in total is Ross (693) followed by Joey (388)

The friend that Ross mentiones the most in total is Rachel (429) followed by Joey (283)

The friend that Chandler mentiones the most in total is Monica (369) followed by Joey (357)
So he mentions his best friend almost as many times as his love interest 

The friend that Monica mentiones the most in total is Chandler (461) followed by Phoebe (342)

The friend that Phoebe mentiones the most in total is Monica (277) followed by Rachel (268) but in general she mentions the friends fairly evenly - the two she mentions the least are Joey and Chandler who she mentions 211 times for both.
