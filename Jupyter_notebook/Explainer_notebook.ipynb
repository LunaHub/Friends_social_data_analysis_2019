The result can then be compared to knowledge about the show.\n",

If two of the main characters appears in the same scene an edge between them is created, if the the edge already exists the weight of the edge is increased. This is done for each season, and for all season. Because the number of scenes is varying through the show, the weight relative to the number of scenes is calculated. The network is undirected, which means that when the network is created the same edge is added two times. By dividing it by 2 we the actually weight.\n",

    "This analysis aims at investigating the social network of all the characters in the show. The goal is to find the most important secondary characters in terms of network analysis and to explore how the most important secondary characters change over seasons. Measures like degree, centrality and modularity is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis uses two dataframes. The first dataframe includeds all spoken lines of all episode including the speaker, the episode, the scene and the characters in the scene. The second includes a list of all relevant speakers. \n",
    "networkX in python is the primary tool used for the analysis. A network of each season and one for all seasons in generated. The networks are generated by iterating over the spoken lines (the rows of the dataframe) and creating nodes of each speaker. The speaker is then connected by an edge to all the other characters in that scene. The edge weight is increased by one for every time a connection between two nodes exists. When plotting the networks the thickness of the edge is defined based on weight and the node size is defined based on the node’s degree. Degree is a measure of how many other nodes a node is connected to. When generating the network we do not connect the main characters to each other. This is because this part of the analysis is focused on the connections to the secondary characters. As the main characters also have very strong connections to each other it would dominate the visualization if they were included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general features of the network are explored including degree distribution as seen in the figure below: \n",
    "<img src = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LunaHub/Friends_social_data_analysis_2019/master/figures/Degree_dist.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "This distribution is a right-skewed Poisson distribution. A Poisson distribution is the characteristics of a random network. However, the skewing approximates a power-law distribution which is the characteristics of real scale-free networks.\n",
    "The degree is also used to find the most important secondary characters of each season and in all seasons. This is illustrated in the figure below. The result fits well with the storyline of the show.\n",

    "The most important characters can also be found by using the frequency of seasons a character appears in. This analysis however, found characters like “bob” which, by knowing the story, is not an important character in the show. It is however, a name that is mentioned a lot in the show. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was also investigated if any communities exist for the network of all the seasons. For this, the Louvain algorithm is applied. This algorithm use modularity to define the communities and attempts to optimize the \"modularity\" of a partition of the network. The modularity for the communities is however 0.09 which means that the communities are weakly separated from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the friendship paradox was investigated. The friendship paradox states that almost all of our friends will have more friends than you. This was true for most of the characters in the network of all seasons. However, it was not true for the six main characters and for the most important secondary characters.\n",
